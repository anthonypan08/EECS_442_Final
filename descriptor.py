        Set feature parameters. For HOG features, either the OpenCV
        implementation (cv2.HOGDescriptor) or scikit-image implementation
        (skimage.feature.hog) may be selected via @param hog_lib. Some
        parameters apply to only one implementation (indicated below).
        @param hog_features (bool): Include HOG features in feature vector.
        @param hist_features (bool): Include color channel histogram features
            in feature vector.
        @param spatial_features (bool): Include spatial features in feature vector.
        @param size (int, int): Resize images to this (width, height) before
            computing features.
        @param hog_lib ["cv", "sk"]: Select the library to be used for HOG
            implementation. "cv" selects OpenCV (@see cv2.HOGDescriptor).
            "sk" selects scikit-image (@see skimage.feature.hog).
        @param pix_per_cell (int, int): HOG pixels per cell.
        @param cells_per_block (int, int): HOG cells per block.
        @param block_stride (int, int): [OpenCV only] Number of pixels by which
            to shift block during HOG block normalization. Defaults to half of
            cells_per_block.
        @param block_norm: [scikit-image only] Block normalization method for
            HOG. OpenCV uses L2-Hys.
        @param transform_sqrt (bool): [scikit-image only].
            @see skimage.feature.hog
        @param hog_bins (int): Number of HOG gradient histogram bins.
        @param signed_gradient (bool): [OpenCV only] Use signed gradient (True)
            or unsigned gradient (False) for HOG. Currently, scikit-image HOG
            only supports unsigned gradients.
        @param hist_bins (int): Number of color histogram bins per color channel.
        @param spatial_size (int, int): Resize images to (width, height) for
            spatial binning.
