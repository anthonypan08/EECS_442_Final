To study the usefulness of web action images for learning better CNN models for action recognition, we collect action images that correspond with the 101 actions in the UCF101[1] dataset. We name this dataset BU101. This dataset contains 23.9K images and here we provide the images for academic research use only.

We collect images by crawling the web using the action class names of UCF101 as queries on image search engines (Google Image Search, Flickr, etc.). Some queries are augmented by the words "exercise", "train" and "play" when appropriate. We inspect each crawled image and remove images that do not contain the action or are cartoons or drawings. We also include 2769 images of relevant actions from the Standford40 dataset[2].
